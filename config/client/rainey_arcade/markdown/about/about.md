Hi! I'm **Brianna Rainey**. I build software like websites, [APIs](https://github.com/tassaron/ttrpg-api), [video games](/arcade), [libraries](https://pypi.org/project/dnd-character/), and [scripts](https://gist.github.com/tassaron/a8ecfd6e30d1785f761a4124c8665b73). I want to become the best I can be, and help others achieve their potential too!âš¡
