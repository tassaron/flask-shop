## Re: Commissions
Do you have a favourite photo of your family members, pets, or a scenic view?
 
Do you want it **recreated** with artistic flair in graphite pencil, pen, charcoal, or paints- oil, acrylic, gouache, or watercolour?

-  Order ahead! Some requests may take 2+ months to complete (based on size and medium; oils typically take much longer to dry and large paintings are naturally more time consuming).
-  Shop local! I avoid using postal services whenever possible to avoid damaging art.
